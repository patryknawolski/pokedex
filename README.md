# Pokédex

A simple Pokédex built with AngularJS that lets you browse pokémons, filter by type and name or sort them, you can click every card and see more details about each of pokémons.

I built it for purpose of improving my AngularJS skills. I've tried to stick as much as possible to [John Papa's styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md).
